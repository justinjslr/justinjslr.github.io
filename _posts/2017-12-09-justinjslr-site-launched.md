Thanks to the [Jonathan McGlone's Guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), I finally launched my official blogging site.
Due to GitHub Pages powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), it was pretty simple to build this site.

Writing my blog will be very simple because I can use markdown in my posts.
Using markdown makes me easy to manage them also.
Iâ€™ll continue to write my post as frequent as possible.
