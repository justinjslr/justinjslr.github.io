Thanks to the [Jonathan McGlone's Guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), I finally launched my official site for blogging.
Since GitHub Pages powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and it was very simple to build this site.

Writing my blog will be very simple because I can use markdown in my posts. It is very easy way to manage my site.
I'll continue to write my post as frequent as possible.
